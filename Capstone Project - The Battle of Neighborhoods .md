Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km (43.5 mi) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north, the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west.Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions. Residents of the city are known as "Sydneysiders".As of June 2019, Sydney's estimated metropolitan population was 5,312,163 and is home to approximately 65% of the state's population. 
The city is also known for its blossoming food scene, which has something for every budget and taste. Sydney has had an unprecedented decade of growth in its food and beverage (F&B) industries and that has positively transformed both the city’s hospitality economy and tourism appeal.
According to a City of Sydney report, from 2007-2017, the number of hospitality businesses in Sydney has jumped by around 45 percent, cementing the city’s status as one of the world’s great food and beverage destinations.
